# **Who Are We**

As a neutral tribunal, the Strata Titles Boards does not advise one party against the other nor provide legal advice on any matter which may potentially be heard before it.
# **Organisation Structure**
### Board Members

The President/Deputy President is a legally qualified person under the Legal Profession Act. Members of the Board comprises experienced practitioners in the building industry, who are accountants, architects, engineers, lawyers, property consultants and quantity surveyors.
